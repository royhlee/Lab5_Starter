1) I would not make a unit test for a message feature because there are too many components such as the UI where a keyboard may pop up, or a how the message will go through servers. 
2) Yes I would use a unit test to see the length of a test, the logic of this test is to ensure that the character limit is not exceeded which can be done in a unit test. It is one component that needs to be tested, and all of the scenarios for this feature can be tested.
